MODULE 13 CHALLENGE; BUILD AN ECOMMERCE BACK END

The back-end for an E-Commerce site was built so that the items in the database could be manipulated in Insomnia.

The Express library was used to handle the server, and Mysql2 and Sequelize were used to create the database.

The Dotenv package was used so sensitve information did not need to be hardcoded into the server, or uploaded to GitHub.

As there is no front-end to this project, all routes were tested through insomnia.
